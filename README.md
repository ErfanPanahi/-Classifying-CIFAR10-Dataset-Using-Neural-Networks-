# -Classifying-CIFAR10-Dataset-Using-Neural-Networks-
In this repository, I am working on classifying the CIFAR10 dataset using neural networks. To achieve this, I initially perform classification using an MLP network. Then, to enhance the network's performance and reduce learning time, I employ convolutional layers, pooling, batch normalization, and dropout layers.
